pca.py - principal component analysis, PCA

  The code performs the following steps:

    Imports the necessary libraries and packages such as numpy, pandas, scipy, and scikit-learn.
    Defines a function draw_vector() that is used later to plot vectors.
    Generates a 2D random dataset consisting of 200 samples by multiplying two randomly generated 2x2 matrices.
    Visualizes the randomly generated dataset using the matplotlib scatter plot function.
    Uses the scikit-learn package
    Implements wiPCA() 
    Computes and visualizes wiPCA() function
    
numpy.py
  
    The code is a Python program that demonstrates the use of NumPy, a library for numerical computing in Python. It imports NumPy and random, and then creates and manipulates various arrays and matrices using NumPy functions and methods.
    
pandas.py
  
    The code demonstrates some basic functions of Pandas, such as mean(), concat(), and sort_values().
